## Introduction
This project is a full-stack application designed to help individuals efficiently manage various aspects of their daily lives, including tasks, movies, reading lists, notes, and calendars.

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, individuals need an efficient way to manage various aspects of their daily lives such as keeping track of movies to watch, reading lists, content calendars, quick notes, and daily tasks. Existing solutions often lack simplicity or focus, making it difficult for users to manage their tasks efficiently in one place.

## Solution
The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack application that allows users to manage tasks, reading and movie lists, notes, and view calendars efficiently. The application will have a Flask API backend supporting user interaction with data, providing a seamless user experience.

## Features
### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, log out, change password, and edit profile picture.
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete daily tasks with the ability to mark them as completed.
- **Reading List**: Add, delete, and edit books in the reading list; mark books as read.
- **Movie List**: Add, delete, and edit movies in the movie list; mark movies as watched.
- **Content Calendar**: Click on a date to create a To-Do list for that specific day.
- **Quick Notes**: Add, edit, and delete quick notes.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications when tasks are completed or near their due date.

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- **Python** (Flask): For developing the backend API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user data, tasks, movies, books, and other information.

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap**: For building the structure and styling of the web pages.
- **JavaScript/React**: For creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Figma**: For designing UI/UX mockups.

### Tools
- **JSON Server**: For handling mock data during frontend development.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x and pip installed.
- PostgreSQL installed and running.
- Node.js and npm installed (for frontend development).

### Backend Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd task-manager-backend
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Configure the database connection in the `config.py` file.

5. **Run the Flask app**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd task-manager-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Backend Development
The backend API is developed using Flask and provides endpoints for handling tasks, reading lists, movies, quick notes, and content calendars. It includes features for user authentication and data handling using RESTful principles.

### Key API Endpoints
- **Tasks**: `/tasks`, `/tasks/<task_id>`
- **Movies**: `/movies`, `/movies/<movie_id>`
- **Reading List**: `/reading-list`, `/reading-list/<book_id>`
- **Notes**: `/notes`, `/notes/<note_id>`
- **Calendar**: `/calendar`, `/calendar/<date>`

## Frontend Development
The frontend is developed using React and follows modern best practices for building responsive and interactive user interfaces. The UI is designed with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness.

### User Interface
- **Tasks Page**: Allows the user to manage their daily tasks.
- **Movies and Reading List**: Separate sections to handle movie and book lists.
- **Quick Notes**: Simple text-based note-taking feature.
- **Content Calendar**: Integrated calendar with a To-Do list creation functionality.

## API Documentation
Detailed API documentation is available in the `api-docs.md` file, providing information about each endpoint, its request and response format, and possible error codes.

## Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Integrate real-time push notifications for task reminders.
- **Advanced Search**: Allow users to search for tasks, notes, movies, and books.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide a dashboard with activity statistics and insights.
